                <h2>
                    VCT STAGE 2 - CHALLENGERS EMEA WEEK 1: ACEND AND TEAM LIQUID BACK ON TOP
                </h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Following a relatively disappointing VCT Stage 1 Masters for EMEA, the squads are back with
                    a vengeance coming into Stage 2.
                    With Week 1 seeing familiar faces like Fnatic and G2 Esports
                    skyrocket to the top of the leaderboard, relative dark horses BBL and current champions, Acend, have
                    also dominated Stage 2's inaugural weekend.
                    <br><br>
                    Miss any of the action? Or simply looking to relive it?
                    Here's our breakdown of VCT Stage 2 Challengers Week 1.
                </p>
                <br><br>

                <h3>
                    Group A: The perfect start for Acend, Fnatic and G2
                </h3>

                <br><br>

                <p>
                    Following a disappointing Stage 1 Challengers for resident Champions, Acend, the squad are
                    back in black (or white and blue) and ready to rumble. The return of star player Aleksander "zeek"
                    Zygmunt after a short hiatus has breathed new life into the team, marking them as ones to watch all
                    over again.
                    <br><br>

                    Fnatic have also come back with a point to prove following their disappointing Stage 1
                    Masters run. With new player Emir Ali "Alfajer" Beder guiding the team to a hard-fought victory over
                    FPX, his Raze is set to blast competitors away if left unchecked.
                    <br><br>

                    Fellow esports behemoths, G2 Esports, also came out of the gate swinging. Taking on DACH
                    Regional League champions, FOKUS, the squad gave Future Earth’s resident samurai a run for their
                    money, but unfortunately fell at the final hurdle on Icebox, giving G2 the win.
                </p>

                <br><br>

                <h3>
                    Group B: BBL, Guild and Team Liquid on top
                </h3>

                <br><br>

                <p>
                    Turkey’s finest, BBL, have come into Stage 2 with victory in their sights, taking down
                    esports icons NAVI in a reverse sweep that saw 34 matches played on Icebox alone. While next week
                    may see them stumble against the might of Team Liquid, this win is the perfect way to start off
                    their run.
                    <br><br>
                    Liquid won’t go down easy, though, as the squad easily felled Berlin International Gaming
                    across Icebox and Split in a series that, unfortunately, wasn’t BIG’s best. While they’re set to
                    meet their match in the form of BBL, it’ll be interesting to see if the Turkist titans manage to
                    topple one of Europe’s most iconic orgs.
                    <br><br>
                    Matching their tempo is Guild, who clashed with M3C in a
                    battle for the ages. With Leo "Leo" Jannesson flexing on the competition in style, Britain’s finest
                    find themselves at the top of the leaderboard.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    WEEK 1 RECAP - ALL OF THE ACTION FROM EMEA’S REGIONAL LEAGUES
                </h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    It’s VCT Stage 2, and the Regional Leagues are back in business. With some of the best teams from
                    across EMEA duking it
                    out to take home their region’s crown, the stakes are as high as ever
                    <br><br>
                    For those who need a quick refresher, EMEA is split into seven different regions: DACH, East,
                    France, MENA, Northern
                    Europe, Spain, and Turkey. This time around, each Regional League will have its own Grand Final,
                    where one team will
                    emerge victorious.
                </p>
                <br><br>

                <p>
                    While we’re only in Week 1, we’ve already seen some insane series, with a whole swathe of teams
                    coming out of the
                    starting gate swinging. Miss any of the action? Here’s our full breakdown of what happened.
                </p>
                <br><br>

                <h3>
                    VALORANT Regional League DACH: Evolution
                </h3>

                <br><br>

                <p>
                    Having narrowly missed out on taking home the title during Stage 1, DSYRE are back with victory in
                    their sights. A
                    dominant showing across Icebox and Haven propelled them into the lead alongside fellow behemoths,
                    MOUZ and Ovation
                    Esports.
                    <br><br>

                    Angry Titans and ALTERNATE aTTaX also put on quite the show during their back and forth opening
                    series. Battling it out
                    across Split and Ascent, each team walked away with a map victory and will be looking to continue to
                    add more wins to
                    their belt in Week 2.
                    <br><br>
                </p>

                <h3>
                    VALORANT Regional League East: Surge
                </h3>

                <br><br>

                <p>
                    Following their disappointing playoffs run during Stage 1, NOM Esports have returned to the fray
                    with fire in their
                    hearts and victory in their minds. Making Bind their stomping ground in each of their matches, they
                    buried their enemies
                    beneath the dusty plains of the abandoned Middle Eastern hamlet.
                    <br><br>
                    They’ll have to be aware of a rival squad, Diamant Esports, though. Slovenia’s finest had a dominant
                    showing against
                    both Zero Tenacity and Entropiq, propelling themselves to the top of the leaderboard.
                </p>

                <br><br>

                <h3>
                    VALORANT Regional League France: Revolution
                </h3>
                <br><br>

                <p>
                    Once again France: Revolution is a star-studded Regional League, packed with some of esports’ most
                    famous faces. While
                    it’s no surprise to see seasoned veterans beGenius at the top of the scoreboard, Karmine Corp have
                    made quite the entry
                    to VALORANT.
                    <br><br>
                    Only dropping six games across both matches, they demolished both Sector One and Mandatory, with the
                    latter only taking
                    a single round. With Amine "Amilwa" Saidi bending Sova to his will and starting off fights with a
                    bang, the sky's the
                    limit for the newcomers.

                </p>
                <br><br>

                <h3>
                    VALORANT Regional League MENA: Resilience
                </h3>
                <br><br>

                <p>
                    MENA’s Regional League is split into two different sections: GCC and Iraq, and Levant and North
                    Africa.
                    <br><br>
                    GCC and Iraq
                    <br><br>
                    Will anyone ever topple Team Falcons? After a dominant run in Stage 1, Saudia Arabia’s finest have
                    soared to the top of
                    the table once more - but it hasn’t been easy. Dropping a game in three of their series, the
                    competition is high and the
                    stakes even higher for the veteran squad.
                    <br><br>
                    Hot on their heels are YaLLa Esports, who picked up former CS pro turned VALORANT star, Issa "ISSAA"
                    Murad in the
                    off-season. With an extensive history playing on top-tier teams like OG and Hellraisers, his debut
                    week saw him play
                    everything from Jett to Chamber marking him not only as one to watch, but a flexible player with a
                    seemingly boundless
                    skillset.
                </p>
                <br><br>

                <h3>
                    VALORANT Regional League Northern Europe: Polaris
                </h3>
                <br><br>

                <p>
                    Coming into Stage 2 with a reformed roster, EXCEL have already made their mark on Northern Europe:
                    Polaris. Sweeping
                    Human Tripwires (who also have a snazzy new logo) aside, they sit alongside Finest, KOVA, and who
                    cars? at the top of
                    the standings.
                    <br><br>
                    Who cars? also took down the powerhouse of Alliance across Bind and Split, already adding an early
                    upset to what
                    promises to be a region absolutely full of them.

                    Today we are thrilled to share the locations of the final two international events of the 2022
                    VALORANT Champions Tour!

                <p>
                    First, the best teams from each region’s Stage 2 Challengers events will meet in Copenhagen, which
                    will play host to the
                    second Masters event of the season. Set to take place from July 10-24, the tournament will feature
                    twelve teams
                    competing for VCT points, prizes, and glory. We’re excited to bring our next international event to
                    a new city and will
                    be announcing additional details about the event in the coming weeks.

                <p>
                    The VALORANT Champions Tour will close out the 2022 season in Istanbul! Champions is the end-of-year
                    final, assembling
                    the top sixteen teams from around the world to compete for the title of VALORANT World Champion.
                    <br><br>

                    Taking place from September 2-18, the event will feature sixteen teams; ten who will qualify through
                    their performance
                    during the regular season and six through the Last Chance Qualifiers taking place in August.
                    <br><br>

                    Our goal is to see our biggest international events played in front of a live audience and both of
                    these cities provided
                    clear pathways towards this goal, while also providing the best possible guarantee that all
                    qualified teams will be able
                    to safely attend and compete. We’re excited to share the initial details of these two events and
                    will be providing more
                    information in the coming weeks.

                    VCT EMEA STAGE 2 CHALLENGERS BEGINS MAY 13
                </h2>
                <br><br>

                <h3>Everything you need to know about the next stage of Europe’s premier VALORANT competition</h3>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    Welcome back to VCT EMEA! Stage 2 picks up where Stage 1 left off — 12 of EMEA’s best VALORANT teams
                    battling for
                    regional supremacy, Circuit Points and a handful of coveted international invitations.
                    <br><br>
                    In Stage 1, few teams could keep up with Fnatic and FunPlus Phoenix, group winners who soon found
                    themselves pitted
                    against each other in the Playoffs’ Upper Bracket Final. FPX won that match — featuring a
                    magnificent 13-0 performance
                    on Split — en route to winning the Grand Final 3-1 against G2 Esports, but their victory was
                    bittersweet. The Stage 1
                    Champions could not compete at Masters 1 due to travel restrictions, and no EMEA team made Top 4 at
                    Reykjavik.
                    <br><br>
                    With plenty left to prove, can FPX remain Kings of EMEA, or will a new team unseat them at the top?
                    In order to follow
                    all the action, here’s everything you need to know about VCT EMEA Stage 2 Challengers.

                </p>
                <br><br>

                <h3>
                    FORMAT OVERVIEW
                </h3>

                <br><br>

                <p>
                    Like Stage 1, the VCT EMEA Stage 2 Challengers format is divided into the Group Stage and Playoffs.
                    During the Group
                    Stage, 12 teams are drawn into two groups of six, where each group plays a single Round Robin. The
                    top three teams of
                    each group advance to the Playoffs, with the first place teams granted an opening bye. All Group
                    Stage matches are
                    best-of-three.
                    <br><br>

                    For Playoffs, the six qualified teams compete in a double elimination bracket. All matches are
                    best-of-three, except for
                    the Lower Bracket Final and Grand Final, which are best-of-five. The top three Playoff finishers
                    will represent EMEA at
                    Masters 2.
                    <br><br>

                    All VCT EMEA Stage 2 Challengers teams will receive Circuit Points based on their finish, points
                    that are needed to
                    qualify for VCT Champions or the Last Chance Qualifier.
                </p>



                <br><br>

                <h3>
                    Group B: BBL, Guild and Team Liquid on top
                </h3>

                <br><br>

                <p>
                    Turkey’s finest, BBL, have come into Stage 2 with victory in their sights, taking down
                    esports icons NAVI in a reverse sweep that saw 34 matches played on Icebox alone. While next week
                    may see them stumble against the might of Team Liquid, this win is the perfect way to start off
                    their run.
                    <br><br>
                    Liquid won’t go down easy, though, as the squad easily felled Berlin International Gaming
                    across Icebox and Split in a series that, unfortunately, wasn’t BIG’s best. While they’re set to
                    meet their match in the form of BBL, it’ll be interesting to see if the Turkist titans manage to
                    topple one of Europe’s most iconic orgs.
                    <br><br>
                    Matching their tempo is Guild, who clashed with M3C in a
                    battle for the ages. With Leo "Leo" Jannesson flexing on the competition in style, Britain’s finest
                    find themselves at the top of the leaderboard.
                </p>

                <h3>PARTICIPATING TEAMS</h3>

                <br><br>

                <p>
                    To determine the groups for VCT EMEA Stage 2 Challengers, the 12 teams were separated into two pools
                    — Stage 1 playoff
                    teams (Pool 1) and Stage 1 teams that fell in the Stage 1 Group Stage (Pool 2). The newly promoted
                    team FOKUS replaced
                    relegated side SuperMassive Blaze in Pool 2.
                    <br><br>
                    Teams were randomly drawn from one pool at a time, starting with Pool 1, followed by Pool 2. Drawn
                    teams were placed
                    into groups in alternating order until the groups were filled.
